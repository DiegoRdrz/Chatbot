Hi...

I don't know how much more of this I can take.

I haven’t slept properly in days, and I can’t stop crying.

I feel like ending it all, like there’s no way out.

I tried talking to someone, but they didn’t understand.

I wish I were dead, maybe things would be easier for everyone.

I'm thinking about suicide a lot lately, and it scares me.

It’s like... I want to disappear.
