Hey...

Lately I’ve been feeling kind of lost.

My job is okay, but I just feel like I’m not moving forward.

I try to stay positive, but it gets hard some days.

I feel disconnected from people, even my family.

Sometimes I just lie in bed and think about how empty everything feels.

I'm not saying I'm in danger, I just feel... low.
